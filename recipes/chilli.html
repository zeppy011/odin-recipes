        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cowboy-style "bowl of red" is all about tender chunks of beef chuck and a five-chile-pepper pur√©e. 
           True to Texas tradition, it has no tomatoes and no beans. The heat is customizable to your taste, and don't skip 
           the masa harina: It helps to thicken the chili and imparts a wonderful earthy richness. This chili is best 
           served a day after cooking.
